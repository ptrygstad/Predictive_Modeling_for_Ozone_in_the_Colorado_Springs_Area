SUMMARY:

This project uses integrates a variety of meterorological data to model ozone pollution concentration in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Accurate predictive models can help public agencies notify affected citizens and coordinate with businesses to mitigate effects to public health and air quality attainment status.

This project produced more accurate reuslts than previously published regional modeling efforts.
